The `arc:on_advancement` action type is triggered when a player receives an advancement.

## Action Data

When this action is triggered, the following [action data](/docs/arc/wiki/action_data/index.mdx) is made available to be used by conditions and rewards:

<ActionDataTable actionType="receive_advancement" />

## Example

The following example will give the player an apple every time they complete any advancement.

```json title="data/my_datapack/arc/apple_for_any_advancement.json"
{
    "holder": {
        "type": "arc:player",
        "id": "arc:player"
    },
    "type": "arc:on_advancement",
    "rewards": [
        {
            "type": "arc:command",
            "command": "give %player% minecraft:apple"
        }
    ]
}
```

:::note Limitation
As of this version, there is no built-in condition to filter by a specific advancement ID. This means the action will trigger for any advancement the player receives. To check for a specific advancement (e.g., minecraft:story/smelt_iron), you would need to create a custom ConditionType that reads the arc:advancement data provided by this action.
