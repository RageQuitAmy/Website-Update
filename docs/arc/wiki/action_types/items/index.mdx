title: Item Action Types

import DocCardList from "@theme/DocCardList";

Action types are the core of Arc Lib's functionality. They define the events that can trigger rewards and conditions in your datapack. Each action type corresponds to a specific event or state in the game, such as a player sprinting, taking damage, or placing a block.

:::tip Can't find what you're looking for?
If you can't find the action type you're looking for, it may be because it hasn't been implemented yet. If you think an action type should be added, feel free to open an issue on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/DAQEM/ArcLib/issues) to suggest it.
