The `arc:on_smelt_item` action type is triggered when a player takes an item out of a furnace, smoker, or blast furnace. Just like experience orbs in vanilla Minecraft, this action also counts the items that are taken out with a hopper. As long as the player takes out one of the smelted items, the action will be triggered. The action is called for every item smelted individually, regardless of how many are taken out at once.

## Action Data

When this action is triggered, the following [action data](/docs/arc/wiki/action_data/index.mdx) is made available to be used by conditions and rewards:

<ActionDataTable actionType="smelt_item" />

## Example

The following example will give the player a Speed II effect every time they smelt an item in a smoker.
