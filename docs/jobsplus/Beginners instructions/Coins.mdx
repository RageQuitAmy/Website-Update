Coins in Jobs+ are used to buy power-ups and more jobs. To earn them, you must level up in your job. Every time you level up, you gain 1 coin. If you wish, this can be changed in the config. If you want to know how many coins you have, open the Jobs+ GUI and the coin amount will be shown at the top.
